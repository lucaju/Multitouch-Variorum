			<line number="4" />
			<speaker>Marchant.</speaker>
			<line number="5" />
			Proceed <variation id="3">Solinus</variation> to procure my fall,

			And by <variation id="4">the</variation> doome of death end woes and all.
			<line number="7" />
			<speaker>Duke.</speaker> Merchant of <variation id="5">Siracusa</variation>, plead no more.
			<line number="8" />
			I am not partiall to infringe our Lawes;
			<line number="9" />
			The enmity and discord which of late
			<line number="10" />
			Sprung from the rancorous outrage of your Duke,
			<line number="11" />
			To Merchants our well-dealing Countrimen,
			<line number="12" />
			Who wanting gilders to redeeme their liues,
			<line number="13" />
			Haue seal’d his rigorous statutes with their blouds,
			<line number="14" />
			Excludes all pitty from our threatning lookes:
			<line number="15" />
			For since the mortall and intestine iarres 
			<line number="16" />
			Twixt thy seditious Countrimen and vs,
			<line number="17" />
			It hath in solemne Synodes beene decreed,
			<line number="18" />
			Both by the <variation id="6">Siracusians</variation> and our selues,
			<line number="19" />
			To admit no trafficke to our aduerse townes:
			<line number="20" />
			Nay more, if any borne at Ephesus
			<line number="21" />
			Be seene at <variation id="7">any</variation> <variation id="94">Siracusian</variation> Marts <variation id="8">and</variation> Fayres:
			<line number="22" />
			Againe, if any <variation id="94">Siracusian</variation> borne
			<line number="23" />
			Come to the Bay of Ephesus, he dies:
			<line number="24" />
			His goods confiscate to the Dukes dispose,
			<line number="25" />
			Vnlesse a thousand markes be leuied
			<line number="26" />
			To quit the penalty, and <variation id="9">to</variation> ransome him:
			<line number="27" />
			Thy substance, valued at the highest rate,
			<line number="28" />
			Cannot amount vnto a hundred <variation id="10">Markes</variation>,
			<line number="29" />
			Therefore by Law thou art condemn’d to die.
			<line number="30" />
			<speaker>Mer.</speaker> Yet <variation id="11">this</variation> my comfort<variation id="12">,</variation> when your words are done,
			<line number="31" />
			My woes end likewise with the euening Sonne.
			<line number="32" />
			<speaker>Duk.</speaker> Well <variation id="94">Siracusian</variation>; say in briefe the cause
			<line number="33" />
			Why thou departedst from thy natiue home?
			<line number="34" />
			And for what cause thou cam’st to Ephesus.
			<line number="35" />
			<speaker>Mer.</speaker> A heauier taske could not haue beene impos’d,
			<line number="36" />
			Then I to speake my <variation id="13">griefes</variation> vnspeakeable:
			<line number="37" />
			Yet that the world may witnesse that my end
			<line number="38" />
			Was wrought by <variation id="14">nature</variation>, not by vile offence,
			<line number="39" />
			Ile vtter what my sorrow giues me leaue.
			<line number="40" />
			In <variation id="15">Syracusa</variation> was I borne, and wedde
			<line number="41" />
			Vnto a woman, happy but for me,
			<line number="42" />
			And by me<variation id="16"></variation>; had not <variation id="17">our</variation> hap beene bad:
			<line number="43" />
			With her I liu’d in ioy, our wealth increast
			<line number="44" />
			By prosperous voyages I often made
			<line number="45" />
			To <variation id="18">Epidamium</variation><variation id="19">,</variation> till my factors death<variation id="20">,</variation>
			<line number="46" />
			And <variation id="21">he</variation><variation id="22"></variation> great <variation id="23">care</variation> of goods at randone <variation id="24">left</variation>,
			<line number="47" />
			Drew me from kinde embracements of my spouse;
			<line number="48" />
			From whom my absence was not sixe moneths olde,
			<line number="49" />
			Before her selfe (almost at fainting vnder
			<line number="50" />
			The pleasing punishment that women beare)
			<line number="51" />
			Had made prouision for her following me,
			<line number="52" />
			And soone, and safe, arriued where I was:
			<line number="53" />
			There <variation id="25">had she</variation> not beene long, but she became
			<line number="54" />
			A ioyfull mother of two goodly sonnes:
			<line number="55" />
			And, which was strange, the one so like the other,
			<line number="56" />
			As could not be distinguish’d but by names.
			<line number="57" />
			That very howre, and in the selfe-same Inne,
			<line number="58" />
			A <variation id="26">meane</variation> woman was <variation id="27">deliuered</variation>
			<line number="59" />
			Of such a burthen<variation id="28"> Male, twins</variation> both alike:
			<line number="60" />
			Those, for their parents were exceeding poore,
			<line number="61" />
			I bought, and brought vp to attend my sonnes.
			<line number="62" />
			My wife, not meanely prowd of two such boyes,
			<line number="63" />
			Made daily motions for our <variation id="29">home returne</variation>:
			<line number="64" />
			Vnwilling<variation id="30"></variation> I agreed<variation id="31">,</variation> alas, too soone<variation id="32"></variation> wee came aboord.
			<line number="65" />
			A league from <variation id="16">Epidamium</variation> had we saild
			<line number="66" />
			Before the alwaies winde-obeying deepe
			<line number="67" />
			Gaue any Tragicke Instance of our harme:
			<line number="68" />
			But longer did we not retaine much hope;
			<line number="69" />
			For what <variation id="33">obscured</variation> light the heauens did grant,
			<line number="70" />
			Did but conuay vnto our fearefull mindes
			<line number="71" />
			A doubtfull warrant of immediate death,
			<line number="72" />
			Which though my selfe would <variation id="34">gladly</variation> haue imbrac’d,
			<line number="73" />
			Yet the incessant <variation id="35">weepings</variation> of my wife,
			<line number="74" />
			Weeping before for what she saw must come,
			<line number="75" />
			And pitteous playnings of the prettie babes
			<line number="76" />
			That mourn’d for fashion, ignorant what to feare,
			<line number="77" />
			Forst me to seeke delayes for them and me,
			<line number="78" />
			And <variation id="36">this</variation> it <variation id="37">was</variation>: (for other meanes was none)
			<line number="79" />
			The Sailors sought for safety by our boate,
			<line number="80" />
			And left the ship<variation id="38"></variation> then sinking ripe<variation id="39"></variation> to vs.
			<line number="81" />
			My wife, <variation id="40">more</variation> carefull for the <variation id="41">latter</variation> borne,
			<line number="82" />
			Had fastned him vnto a small spare Mast,
			<line number="83" />
			Such as sea-<variation id="42">faring</variation> men prouide for stormes:
			<line number="84" />
			To him one of the other twins was bound,
			<line number="85" />
			Whil’st I had beene like heedfull of the other.
			<line number="86" />
			The children thus dispos’d, my wife and I,
			<line number="87" />
			Fixing our eyes on whom our care was fixt,
			<line number="88" />
			Fastned our selues at <variation id="43">eyther end the</variation> <variation id="44">mast</variation>,
			<line number="89" />
			<variation id="45">And</variation> floating straight, obedient to the streame,
			<line number="90" />
			<variation id="46">Was</variation> carried towards Corinth, as we thought.
			<line number="91" />
			At length the sonne gazing vpon the earth,
			<line number="92" />
			Disperst those vapours that offended vs,
			<line number="93" />
			And by the benefit of his <variation id="47">wished</variation> light
			<line number="94" />
			The <variation id="48">seas waxt</variation> calme, and we <variation id="49">discouered</variation>
			<line number="95" />
			Two shippes<variation id="50"></variation> from farre<variation id="51">,</variation> making amaine to vs:
			<line number="96" />
			Of Corinth that, of Epidarus this,
			<line number="97" />
			But ere they came, oh let me say no more,
			<line number="98" />
			Gather the sequell by that went before.
			<line number="99" />
			<speaker>Duk.</speaker> Nay forward old man, doe not breake off so,
			<line number="100" />
			For we may pitty, though not pardon thee.
			<line number="101" />
			<speaker>Merch.</speaker> Oh had the gods done so, I had not now
			<line number="102" />
			Worthily tearm’d them mercilesse to vs:
			<line number="103" />
			For ere the ships could meet by twice fiue leagues,
			<line number="104" />
			We were encountred by a mighty rocke,
			<line number="105" />
			Which being violently borne <variation id="52">vp</variation>,
			<line number="106" />
			Our <variation id="53">helpefull</variation> ship was splitted in the midst;
			<line number="107" />
			So that in this vniust diuorce of vs,
			<line number="108" />
			Fortune had left to both of vs alike,
			<line number="109" />
			What to delight in, what to sorrow for,
			<line number="110" />
			Her part, poore soule, seeming as burdened
			<line number="111" />
			With lesser waight, but not with lesser woe,
			<line number="112" />
			Was carried with more speed before the winde,
			<line number="113" />
			And in our sight they three were taken vp
			<line number="114" />
			By Fishermen of Corinth, as we thought.
			<line number="115" />
			At length <variation id="54">another</variation> ship had seiz’d on vs,
			<line number="116" />
			And knowing whom it was their hap to saue,
			<line number="117" />
			Gaue <variation id="55">healthfull</variation> welcome to their ship-<variation id="56">wrackt</variation> guests,
			<line number="118" />
			And would haue reft the <variation id="57">Fishers</variation> of their prey,
			<line number="119" />
			Had not their <variation id="58">backe</variation> beene very slow <variation id="59">of</variation> saile;
			<line number="120" />
			And therefore homeward did they <variation id="60">bend</variation> their course.
			<line number="121" />
			Thus haue you heard me seuer’d from my blisse,
			<line number="122" />
			<variation id="61">That</variation> by <variation id="62">misfortunes</variation> was my life prolong’d,
			<line number="123" />
			To tell sad stories of <variation id="63">my</variation> owne mishaps.
			<line number="124" />			
			<speaker>Duke.</speaker> And for the <variation id="64">sake</variation> of them thou sorrowest for,
			<line number="125" />
			Doe me the fauour to dilate <variation id="65">at</variation> full,
			<line number="126" />
			What <variation id="66">haue</variation> <variation id="67">befalne of</variation> them and <variation id="68">they</variation> till now.
			<line number="127" />
			<speaker>Merch.</speaker> My yongest boy, and yet my eldest care,
			<line number="128" />
			At eighteene yeeres became inquisitiue
			<line number="129" />
			After his brother; and importun’d me
			<line number="130" />
			That his attendant, <variation id="69">so</variation> his case was like,
			<line number="131" />
			Reft of his brother, but retain’d his name,
			<line number="132" />
			Might beare him company in <variation id="70">the</variation> quest of him:
			<line number="133" />
			Whom whil’st <variation id="71">I</variation> laboured of <variation id="72">a loue</variation> to see,
			<line number="134" />
			I hazarded the losse of whom I lou’d.
			<line number="135" />
			Fiue Sommers haue I spent in <variation id="73">farthest</variation> <variation id="74">Greece</variation>,
			<line number="136" />
			Roming cleane through the bounds of Asia,
			<line number="137" />
			And coasting homeward, came to Ephesus:
			<line number="138" />
			Hopelesse to finde, yet loth to leaue vnsought
			<line number="139" />
			<variation id="75">Or</variation> that, or any place that harbours men:
			<line number="140" />
			But <variation id="76">heere</variation> must end the story of my life,
			<line number="141" />
			And happy were I in my timelie death,
			<line number="142" />
			Could all my trauells warrant me they liue.
			<line number="143" />
			<speaker>Duke.</speaker> Haplesse Egeon whom the fates haue markt
			<line number="144" />
			To beare the extremitie of<variation id="77"></variation> dire mishap:
			<line number="145" />
			Now trust me, were it not against our Lawes,
			<line number="146" />
			<variation id="78">Against my Crowne, my oath, my dignity,

			Which Princes<variation id="79"></variation> would<variation id="80"></variation> they<variation id="81"></variation> may not disanull,</variation>
			<line number="148" />
			My soule should sue as aduocate for thee:
			<line number="149" />
			But though thou art adiudged to the death,
			<line number="150" />
			And passed sentence may not be recal’d
			<line number="151" />
			But to our honours great disparagement:
